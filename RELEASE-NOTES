isaac 0.0.3

* Based on Bob Jenkins' comments on ruby-talk, use 256-entry state vectors, rather than 16-entry. Also, some benchmarking (bench/bench.rb) verifies that,
for long sequences, 256-entry state vectors are slightly faster, so even for simulation there is not much reason to use 16-entry vectors, unless you have a large number of sequences.

* Fixed #srand so that it clears the entire state before setting the seed, so
that an instance can be reset to produce the same sequence. However, #srand no
longer returns the current state values, since they may differ from the original seed values.

isaac 0.0.2

* First public release

isaac 0.0.1
